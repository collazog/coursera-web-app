        <p>What chickens eat and what chickens should eat are not always the same thing. Chickens are omnivores. That means they’ll snarf down just about anything, or at least try to! I’ve seen a hen catch and slurp down a snake like spaghetti. I’ve seen a chicken snatch a toad by it’s leg and all of the other hens go in a raucous chase after it, only, at the end to discover that a toad is not good eating. Chickens also eat less exciting foods, like vegetables, fruits, flowers and grass. They eat grains and seeds. They scratch the ground and find bugs and specks of things that we can’t see. So, the question isn’t really what chickens eat, but what the right diet is for them.
        In the 19th century most chickens were barnyard scavengers. They hatched out under their mamas and were taught to look for grain in the horse stalls, and for bugs and greens in the garden. The farm wife tossed stale bread and kitchen scraps to the hens. Chickens destined for the table were fattened on sour milk. Sometimes, in the winter, they’d be given a handful of grain. The hens back then laid only a few eggs a week. This haphazard diet was enough sustenance for them. But, flocks became larger and more confined. Chickens were bred to lay more and more eggs. Instead of 90 eggs a year, a hen now might lay over 300. With the increase in egg production came an increase in the nutritional requirements of the flock.

        <p>This is a list of beef dishes and foods. Beef is the culinary name for meat from bovines, especially cattle. Beef can be harvested from cows, bulls, heifers or steers. Acceptability as a food source varies in different parts of the world.
        Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat production worldwide, after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively. In absolute numbers, the United States, Brazil, and the People's Republic of China are the world's three largest consumers of beef. On a per capita basis in 2009, Argentines consumed the most beef at 64.6 kg per person; people in the U.S. ate 40.2 kg, while those in the E.U. ate 16.9 kg.

        <p>The origin of sushi is believed to have been during the second century A.D. in Southeast Asia because of the need to keep meat fresh without refrigeration. They would cure meat and fish and wrap it in rice to preserve its freshness. It was then left to ferment for several months. If the meat and fish were treated this way, it could be preserved for several months longer than being cured alone. Eventually, when enough time had passed, they would discard the rice and eat the cured insides.

        The idea eventually spread through China and then to Japan, where fish is a food staple. The Japanese would ferment their cured-fish-and-rice sushi with Japanese rice wine, or sake.
        About ten centuries later, people started adding vinegar to their sushi to aid in the fermentation process. This way, they didn't have to wait so many months for the sushi to be ready.
        In the 1820's, chefs started using raw fish in their sushi, known as Edo-style sushi. This is the style you will find in most sushi restaurants.
        Nearly 100 years later, when Tokyo was dominated by food service stalls, vendors invented nigiri-sushi, or raw fish placed atop shaped rice. This type of sushi is sometimes referred to as "hand sushi" because of its portability.
        After World War II, the use of street stalls to sell fish decreased in favor of more sanitary indoor conditions, but the nigiri-style remained.
        In the past 20 years, as sushi is being recognized as a healthy alternative, sushi restaurants have flourished in the United States. Rolls like the California  Roll, which is made with cucumber instead of fish, were introduced to Westerners who might be weary of the idea of sushi.
        Today, thanks to mass production and globalization, sushi is a common meal in many parts of the world.
